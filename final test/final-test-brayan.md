# Machine Learning for Masters Final Test

## Name: Brayan Duran Medina

### 2. What is the gradient? How is it used in optimization?

### 4. What is validation? Cross validation?

### 6. What are precision and recall metrics?

### 8. How are parameters different from hyperparameters? E.g. what are parameters in linear models and decision trees? Hyperparameters?

### 10. What is backpropagation? How does it work? E.g. how would gradient propagate through a linear layer? Through ReLU?

### 12. What is dropout? How does it work in a neural network? Does it change its behaviour on the inference (test) stage?

### 14. How does RNN work? Can you combine CNN and RNN somehow?
